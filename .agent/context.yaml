    name: ctx
    summary: Offline, repo-local CLI for managing developer context, intent, and prompts without network access.
    template: default
architecture:
    style: cli-offline
    version: v1
    notes: Single static Go binary (Cobra) that reads/writes .agent/ data in-repo; deterministic, no telemetry or network calls.
standards:
    code:
        - Go 1.21+; cobra commands kept small and composable.
        - No runtime network calls or telemetry; all I/O is repo-local.
        - Keep persisted YAML/Markdown human-editable and backward compatible.
    process:
        - Keep prompts token-cheap; prefer summaries over full dumps.
        - Reference evidence paths; do not inline logs.
        - Default to offline operation; avoid introducing external services.
constraints:
    - Keep prompts token-cheap; expand context only when profile requests.
    - Maintain portable state inside the repo for agent switching and parallel work.
    - Preserve backward compatibility of .agent/ artifacts and CLI flags.
quality_gates:
    - All tests pass and lint is clean.
    - No breaking API changes.
    - Prompt written to .agent/exports/current.prompt.md.
